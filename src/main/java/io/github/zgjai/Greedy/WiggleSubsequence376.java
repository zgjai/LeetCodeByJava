/**
 * A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate
 * between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence
 * with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.
 * <p>
 * For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and
 * negative. In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two
 * differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.
 * <p>
 * Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence
 * is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the
 * remaining elements in their original order.
