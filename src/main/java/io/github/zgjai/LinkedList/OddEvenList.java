/**
 * Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking
 * about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
 * 
 * You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.
 * 
 * Example: Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, return 1->3->5->2->4->NULL.
 * 
 * Note: The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input. The first node is
 * considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
