/**
 * Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
 * 
 * k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a
 * multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
 * 
 * You may not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
 * 
 * Only constant memory is allowed.
 * 
 * For example, Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
 * 
 * For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
 * 
 * For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
